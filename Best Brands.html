	<p>Obviously hundreds of thousands of brands sell dresses of every style and type you can imagine, and narrowoing them down can be a difficult task. It's easiest to consider a few simple catefories or standards you should have for every company that you purchase from to be sure the dress is worth it. Rules I like to follow when purchasing dresses are:</p>
<ul>
	<li> Appropriate price range - This can vary for everyone, but shop responsibly </li>
	<li> Sustainable and ethical production practices - This is a more personl prefernce, however it is important to be aware of suspiciously cheap products and the companys labor and manufacturing practices </li>
	<li> Safe and reliable company - Especially when shopping online, it is important to authenticate the site to make sure you aren't getting scammed </li>
</ul>
